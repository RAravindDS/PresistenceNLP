In XLNet it masks 20% of the data, so you need to predict more words but the drawback is that, if you don't know previous word how do you predict the current word. I  mean XLNet is a autoregressive so it look only one direction, if you have a word to predict inbetween and word to predict in last, without knowing the first predicting word, you can't know the last prediciting word. If it goes like this it needs lot of training time. In order to achieve to look both the side and autoregressive, we need a architecutre change by adding **Masked Two Stream Attention**. "
